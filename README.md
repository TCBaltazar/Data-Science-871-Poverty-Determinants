# Poverty Determinants Brazil (2021)
 Research Project submitted for first semester Applied Microeconomics course at Stellenbosch University

The elimination of extreme poverty was one of the main pillars of the United Nations
Millennium Development Goals, and, to a large extent, nations have been successful in
eliminating the most extreme forms of deprivation. Whilst significant strides have been made in
reducing the levels of absolute income poverty over the last decades, relative income inequality
has risen (Alvaredo, & Gasparini, 2013). Brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the
world, along with South Africa, and has been, hyperbolically, referred to as a ‘Belindia’; with a
large segment of poor coexisting with a small enclave of rich. Since the mid 1990’s, however,
Brazil has undergone a period of rapid poverty reduction, which Ferreira De Souza (2012)
attributes to more effective social policies and a **consumer-led** economic boom. The goal of this
paper is to determine what the most significant determinants of the poverty headcount ratio in
Brazil were for the period 1985-2018 by employing a LASSO procedure for variable selection
among a potential list of 35 predictors included in the final dataset. The LASSO will be used
for three models, specifying different values of the tuning parameter (\lambda), and the best model of this cohort will be selected by evaluating which one results in the highest prediction accuracy.
